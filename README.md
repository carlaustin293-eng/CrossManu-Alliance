# CrossManu Alliance

## Overview

CrossManu Alliance is a Web3 project built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. It establishes a decentralized alliance among manufacturers to share product complaint data securely and transparently. This enables virtual interoperability checks (e.g., simulating compatibility between products from different brands) and facilitates in-person collaborative repairs through escrow-based coordination.

The project addresses real-world problems in industries like automotive, electronics, and consumer goods, where:
- Lack of shared data leads to repeated compatibility issues (e.g., a third-party accessory failing with multiple device brands).
- Manufacturers operate in silos, delaying root-cause analysis for widespread complaints.
- Collaborative repairs are hindered by trust issues, payment disputes, and data privacy concerns.

By leveraging blockchain, CrossManu ensures immutable data sharing, permissioned access, incentive mechanisms for participation, and automated workflows for checks and repairs. This reduces product failures, accelerates innovations in interoperability standards, and fosters trust among competitors.

## Key Features

- **Shared Complaint Database**: Manufacturers submit anonymized complaint data, which is stored on-chain for alliance members to query.
- **Virtual Interoperability Simulator**: A smart contract that runs rule-based checks on shared data to predict compatibility issues.
- **Collaborative Repair Escrow**: Secure, multi-party escrow for funding and verifying in-person repairs.
- **Governance and Incentives**: Token-based voting and rewards for data contributions.
- **Privacy-Preserving Access**: Zero-knowledge proofs (via Clarity extensions if needed) or role-based access to sensitive data.
- **Integration with Off-Chain Tools**: Oracles for feeding real-world repair outcomes back to the chain.

## Technology Stack

- **Blockchain**: Stacks (secured by Bitcoin).
- **Smart Contract Language**: Clarity (predictable, secure, and non-Turing complete).
- **Deployment**: Use Clarinet for local testing and Stacks CLI for mainnet deployment.
- **Frontend (Optional)**: A simple web dApp using Stacks.js for user interactions (not included in this README).

## Smart Contracts

The project consists of 6 core Clarity smart contracts, each handling a specific aspect of the alliance. They interact via public functions and traits for modularity.

1. **AllianceMembership.clar**
   - Manages manufacturer onboarding, verification, and expulsion.
   - Key Functions:
     - `join-alliance`: Allows a principal to join after staking tokens or providing proof (e.g., KYC hash).
     - `leave-alliance`: Handles graceful exit with data retention policies.
     - `verify-member`: Checks if a principal is an active member.
   - Traits: Implements a membership trait for access control in other contracts.
   - Solves: Ensures only trusted manufacturers participate, preventing spam or malicious data.

2. **ComplaintRegistry.clar**
   - Stores and indexes complaint data submitted by members.
   - Key Functions:
     - `submit-complaint`: Records a complaint with fields like product ID, issue description (hashed for privacy), and metadata.
     - `query-complaints`: Retrieves filtered complaints (e.g., by product category or manufacturer).
     - `update-complaint-status`: Marks complaints as resolved after repairs.
   - Data Structures: Uses maps for complaint IDs to details, with timestamps for immutability.
   - Solves: Creates a tamper-proof repository of issues, enabling pattern detection across brands.

3. **DataSharing.clar**
   - Handles permissioned access to shared data with privacy controls.
   - Key Functions:
     - `grant-access`: Allows members to share specific data subsets with others.
     - `request-data`: Submits a request for data, approved via governance.
     - `revoke-access`: Removes permissions dynamically.
   - Integrates with AllianceMembership for role checks.
   - Solves: Balances data sharing with IP protection, using on-chain ACLs to prevent unauthorized leaks.

4. **InteroperabilityChecker.clar**
   - Performs virtual checks on compatibility using shared complaint data.
   - Key Functions:
     - `run-check`: Takes product specs from two manufacturers and simulates interoperability based on historical complaints (e.g., rule-based logic like "if complaint rate > 5%, flag as incompatible").
     - `log-result`: Stores check outcomes for future reference.
     - `aggregate-stats`: Computes stats like failure rates across alliances.
   - Uses simple Clarity logic (e.g., folds over maps) for simulations; complex computations can be offloaded to oracles.
   - Solves: Proactively identifies interoperability issues, reducing recalls and user frustrations.

5. **RepairCollaboration.clar**
   - Coordinates in-person repairs via escrow and multi-sig.
   - Key Functions:
     - `initiate-repair`: Starts a repair proposal with escrow deposit from involved parties.
     - `join-repair`: Allows other members to collaborate (e.g., provide parts or expertise).
     - `complete-repair`: Releases escrow upon multi-party confirmation (e.g., via signatures).
     - `dispute-resolution`: Triggers governance voting for disputes.
   - Integrates with an external oracle for off-chain verification (e.g., repair photos hashed on-chain).
   - Solves: Enables cross-manufacturer repairs without intermediaries, ensuring fair payment and accountability.

6. **GovernanceToken.clar**
   - Manages a fungible token (CMAT) for incentives and voting.
   - Key Functions:
     - `mint-tokens`: Rewards members for submitting data or completing repairs.
     - `vote-proposal`: Allows token holders to vote on alliance decisions (e.g., new rules or expulsions).
     - `execute-proposal`: Automatically enacts passed votes.
     - `stake-tokens`: Locks tokens for membership boosts.
   - Follows SIP-010 standard for FTs on Stacks.
   - Solves: Incentivizes participation and decentralizes control, aligning interests in the alliance.

## How It Works

1. **Onboarding**: Manufacturers join via AllianceMembership, staking CMAT tokens.
2. **Data Submission**: Use ComplaintRegistry to log issues; DataSharing controls access.
3. **Virtual Checks**: Query data and run InteroperabilityChecker to simulate compatibility.
4. **Collaborative Repairs**: If an issue requires physical fixes, initiate via RepairCollaboration; escrow ensures trust.
5. **Governance**: Use GovernanceToken for decisions, with rewards distributed for contributions.
6. **Resolution**: Update statuses in ComplaintRegistry; aggregate data improves future products.

This flow creates a feedback loop: Shared complaints → Virtual checks → Collaborative fixes → Updated data.

## Installation and Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Install Clarinet: `cargo install clarinet`.
- Stacks Wallet for testing (e.g., Hiro Wallet).
- Node.js for any frontend (optional).

### Steps
1. Clone the repo: `git clone <repo-url>`.
2. Navigate to project: `cd crossmanu-alliance`.
3. Initialize Clarinet project: `clarinet new .` (if not pre-set).
4. Add contracts: Place the .clar files in `contracts/` directory.
5. Test locally: `clarinet test`.
6. Deploy to testnet: Use `clarinet deploy` or Stacks CLI.
7. Interact: Use Clarinet console or build a dApp with Stacks.js.

Example contract deployment script (in `deployments/devnet-plan.yaml`):
```yaml
id: 0
name: Deploy CrossManu Contracts
deploys:
  - name: AllianceMembership
    contract: alliance-membership.clar
  # Add others similarly
```

## Usage

- **Submit a Complaint**: Call `submit-complaint` on ComplaintRegistry with payload like `(define-data-var complaint { id: u1, description: "Battery incompatibility", product: "WidgetX" })`.
- **Run Check**: Invoke `run-check` with params like `(run-check 'SP123... "ProductA" 'SP456... "ProductB")`.
- **Vote**: Stake tokens and call `vote-proposal` on GovernanceToken.
